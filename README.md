\# Stroke Prediction



This repository contains a data science project that focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on various health-related features. It is designed as a beginner-level project to practice data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.



\## 🧠 Objective

To build a predictive model that identifies the risk of stroke using clinical and demographic data.



\## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes health indicators such as:

\- Age

\- Hypertension

\- Heart Disease

\- Average Glucose Level

\- BMI

\- Smoking Status

\- etc.



\## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* RStudio
* R language





\## 🔍 Project Steps

1\. Data loading and exploration

2\. Data cleaning and preprocessing

3\. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

4\. Model training (e.g., Random Forest)

5\. Model evaluation



\## 📁 Files

\- `stroke\_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for analysis and modeling

\- `stroke\_data.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing



\## ✅ Outcome

A classification model that predicts stroke risk, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall evaluated on test data.



\## 💡 Notes

This project is created as part of a Coursera capstone project and intended for learning purposes.
